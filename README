1.1 how to run compile procedure on win32 platform ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
answer  : 
0) you must have installed MASM, FlexDLL and binaries must be in path.
1) install some project which contain 'make' (mingw for exemple)
2) you must have installed Visual Studio and vcvarsall.bat file must be in path(default path is ~ C:\Program Files\MVS10\VC). 
3) Then, before compilation, run this:
vcvarsall.bat

4) run make
mingw32-make clean
mingw32-make fswin.exe
